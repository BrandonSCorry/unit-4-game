using $.each - try to 1) display each crystal image 2) assign each crystal a hidden random number 
   and 3) assign each crystal name to match with  

update - clear score to 0, re-randomize crystal values and target(random number

update - wins++; losses++


target(random number) value between 19-125

individual crystals between 1-12



1. layout
  - title
   - rules
   game displays: 
     -random target number random between 19-125, 
     -4 crystal image on click options (randomized # between 1-12)
     -user total score from crystal clicks (add)
     - wins/losses

2. randomize target number floor...random * ... 19-125
   (how to randomize between 2 specific #s)

3. assign each crystal to random number... 1-12


4. on crystal click add the crystal random value number to the user total score
    -as long as user #is less than total score keep playing

5. if users total # == target # then
     - wins++
     - (update) reassign each crystals random value number
     - (update)reassign target number to diff random # 19-125
     - reset users score back to 0

6. if users total score is higher than the target number
     - losses++
     - (update) reassign each crystals random value number
     - (update)reassign target number to diff random # 19-125




what ive done so far:

generate images & image ID

generate random total crystal target number

todo: add individual crystal rand num to userTotal





     - reset users score back to 0
